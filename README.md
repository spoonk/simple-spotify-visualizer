# Spotify Visualizer
Welcome to the repository for my spotify visualizer application. Unfortunately, I haven't
set up a live version of this app but I plan on doing it soon. 

## What is this app?
This simple app displays what you are currently listening to on Spotify. The color palette dynamically updates to fit well with the album cover, hopefully making a pleasant viewing experience.

It uses the Spotify API for authentication as well as fetching information about the currently playing track. 

The colors used in the app depend on the album cover of the song, dynamically updating when the song changes.

## Using this app
If you would like to run the app locally, clone this repo and run `npm install` from within the `frontend`and `server`directories. Then, you will need to create an app from the [spotify dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications), which may require spotify premium. This will provide you with a Client ID and a Client Secret. Make a file called `credentials.js` in the `server` directory and put
those two client values in that file as follows:
````
const clientId = 'thisismyclientid';
const clientSecret = 'thisismycliensecret'

module.exports = {clientId, clientSecret}
````

Then, you should be able to run the app by calling `npm start` from within `frontend`Â and calling `node .` from within `server`.

If that's too much, checkout the screenshots below and hope I post a live version of the app soon :)
